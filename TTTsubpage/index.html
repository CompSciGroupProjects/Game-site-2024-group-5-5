    TicTacToe Rules

<div id="tttRules">
    Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players (either Computer vs. Player or Player vs. Player) take turns marking empty cells with their chosen symbols, usually "X" and "O", until one player successfully forms a line of three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this game, you can switch between Two-Player and Player vs. Computer. The game requires strategic thinking to both block your opponent's moves and create opportunities for your own wins. Are you ready to play?
